# workflow-management-system-backend

The developed system is a workflow management system (https://master--delightful-licorice-d3ecf6.netlify.app/login) and it is a proof of concept that will be used by the Galle District Irrigation Department of Sri Lanka. Currently, most of the administrative work is carried out manually using paper-based approaches. Using this system for the management of workflows will help to reduce many overheads and to simplify management tasks. Since the system is used only by the organisationâ€™s (Galle district irrigation department) employees, after registering through the signup page of the application, further email verification and approval from a DI (director of Irrigation) is required to enter the system. The system has several user roles and DI (Director of Irrigation) is one such user role. Only the DI can create a workflow in the system by creating any number of subtasks under the new workflow. Furthermore, any number of employees can be assigned to each subtask. The employees then must carry out the specific subtask assigned for them.
